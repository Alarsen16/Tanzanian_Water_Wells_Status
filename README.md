# Tanzanian_Water_Wells_Status
## Overview
This project uses classificational modeling to accurately predict the current state of water wells that are spread throughout the African nation of Tanzania. The purpose for the prediction model is to aid The Tanzanian Water Project organization on finding water wells that are not functioning for them to go in and possibly repair. Also to give reasoning on why the well is currently non-functional.

## Business Understanding
 

#### Map of Tanzania and locations showing functional/needswork/non-functional wells(if kept as ternary)


## Modeling
### K-Nearest Neighbors

### Decision Trees
### Losgistic Regression
### Rain Forest(Possibly)
### Naive Bayes(Possibly)
##### sort in acsending model performance with best model being final



## Evaluation
